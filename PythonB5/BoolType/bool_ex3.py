# We are given three sides of a triangle.
# Triangle is equallateral when all sides are the same.
# So in this code we have to display True when triangle is equilateral, # False otherwise.

 a = 9
 b = 9
 c = 9

is_equilateral = a == b == c 
# the calculation above is possible
# because python supports 
# chained comparison operator.
print (is_equilateral)
